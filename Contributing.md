# Contributing to Wrye Bash

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Wrye Bash is a mod management utility with a rich set of features. The following
is a set of guidelines for contributing to Wrye Bash and its packages.
You can contribute either by providing a good bug report, contributing code or
making a donation.
For basic info on installation and set up see our
[main readme](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash) and links there.
In particular:

- [Installation](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash#installation)
- [Questions & Feedback](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash#questions--feedback-)
- [Latest betas](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash#latest-betas)

## Reporting Bugs

**IMPORTANT**:
Before posting an issue, be sure to ask at one of the forum threads linked under
[Questions & Feedback](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash#questions--feedback-);
maybe the bug is already fixed in some development version or you are doing
something wrong. **Post an issue on github *ONLY* after doing so**
and then making sure the bug is not already on the bug tracker by [searching on
the key elements of your problem](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/)

Please also read the [relevant page in our wiki](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/wiki/[github]-Reporting-a-bug#the-bashbugdumplog).

## Contributing Code

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to
help advance this project.

Good starting points are  [issue 200](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/issues/200) and the ['good first issues'](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aopen+label%3AM-good-first-issue).

#### Set up

To contribute, set up a fork and PyCharm [as detailed here](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/wiki/%5Bdev%5D-Set-up-Pycharm-for-wrye-bash).

Our wiki contains dev, git and github labelled articles to get you started with
setting up the repository and git basics. Please read at least:

* [[dev] Coding Style](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/wiki/%5Bdev%5D-Coding-Style)
* [[dev] Deciphering Source Filenames](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/wiki/%5Bdev%5D-Deciphering-Source-Filenames)
* [[dev] Commit guidelines](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/wiki/%5Bdev%5D-Commit-guidelines)
* [[git] Syncing a Fork with the main repository](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/wiki/%5Bgit%5D-Syncing-a-Fork-with-the-main-repository).
* [[github] Branching Model & Using The Repository](/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/wiki/%5Bgithub%5D-Branching-Model-&-Using-The-Repository)

When ready: do not issue a pull request - contact instead a member of the team
in the relevant issue or mentioning them on your commit and let them review.
Then those branches can be pulled from your fork and integrated with upstream.
Once this is done a couple times you get *write* privileges.

#### Main Branches

* [dev](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/tree/dev): The main development
branch - approved commits end up here. *Do not directly push to this branch* -
push to your branches and contact someone from the owners team in the relevant
issue.
* [master](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/tree/master): The production
branch, contains stable releases. Use it only as reference.
* [nightly](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/tree/nightly):
Bleeding edge branch. Commits land here for testing.

#### Governance Model

The Governance Model for Wrye-Bash is similar to that laid out for
[Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/governance-model.html).
See that article for details.
